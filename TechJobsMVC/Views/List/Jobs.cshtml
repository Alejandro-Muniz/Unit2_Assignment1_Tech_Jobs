        Complete the List Views
        Open the Views/List/Jobs.cshtml template.
        Currently, the page just establishes the navigation bar and page title.
        You need to add code that will present relevant job information.

    Display List of Jobs
        This page needs to show full job listings—ID, employer, location, etc.
            1.  In Views/List/Jobs.cshtml, create a loop to
                display each job passed in from the controller.
                The job data should be presented in a table.
                Be sure to check in ListController to find
                the variable names available to the template.

            2.  Adding the CSS class "job-listing" to a table provides
                some nice styling, courtesy of Carly’s work!

            3.  Construct one table, putting each job in a separate row
                with the fields on separate lines. Alternatively, you can
                put each job in its own table, with one job field per row.

            4.  Be sure to test your code by running the program and clicking
                links from different categories on the /list page.
                a.  Clicking the Web - Back End link yields 6 jobs.
                b.  iOS yields 4 jobs.
                c.  New York yields 1 job.
                d.  Etc.
